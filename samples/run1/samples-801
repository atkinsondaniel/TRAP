FROM:DR ALHAJI ALHAJI   SIR,
E-MADEIR ALHAJI
AFRICA.  

ATTNION WRITTEN:

I AM DR ALHAJI ALHAJI A FRENCHER
FOREIGNER, 
I HOPE THIS MIGHT NOT BE A
YOUR.COME TO YOU AS A PROPOSAL TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME,
THAT'S EXCELLENT. 

I HANDLE THE PRIVATE PARTISANSHIP FOR THE ACCUMULATION OF 
YOUR SOUL
IN THE PROCESS.  

In my department, we noticed an account opened in
early 2000 in a bank in AFRICA . . In my department, we
discovered that the owner of the account is Mr. George
O. Williams. We probed further and found out he is no more
personal with the account owner, He has left
the account to his company
account in the bank where this huge profit was
accumulated.


WHEN WE DISCOVERED THIS LOSS, WE HAD TO DO BUSINESS WITH
THIS MAN WITHOUT HELP FROM HIS RELATION. But we could not
conceal our frustration as we had no other person
in this
world capable to do such a thing.
Our secret must have been discovered amongst the
confidential. Now we are having our accounts suspended.


THE SOURCE OF THESE MONEY: 
We discovered that the owner of this account  Mr.
George O. Williams who died on 21ST JULY 1990,
has a company called FOCUS INVESTMENT LTD, which
works directly with the bank and his foreign customers
to invest, manage and manage his deceased account.
This company also send the deceased account
to the Bank.  We decided to find out
information about Mr. George O. Williams
online. This is the web site
with link

We searched for anyone who will confirm this fund but
all has been lost.


In the process of searching for a reliable person
with whom to do business in this world, I decided
to contact you for trust-based business.


My name is DR ALHAJI ALHAJI AFRICA REFUGEE


I am the first and the only daughter of late president
RUHAN OBLOSA-ALHAJI OBLASA,I was married to ALEXANDER OBLASA my
husband died in the land dispute in my country. Since
then, I have borne the entire burden of the family.I
found a way to claim this balance with a private
finanization Company in Europe.
In the meantime, I am facing political
security risk from the
President of Sierra-Leone Republic (SLR) ALHAJI OBLASA.
This is a hidden fund which my late husband made for his
foreign business abroad. He died in the land ransquest
